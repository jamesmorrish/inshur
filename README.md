# The Inshur Coding Challenge ðŸ’»

## Notes ðŸ› 
I have implemented two GET API endpoints - http://localhost:4000/api/v1/users and http://localhost:4000/api/v1/users/:username - the first provides a list of all usernames from the "database", the second returns the details of an individual user.

I have updated the React App to read from these two endpoints and display the data.

I have implemented some basic styling, but have not taken this very far.

There are separate tests for the API and the React components.

I have left a few TODOs in the code to indicate some possible next steps.
